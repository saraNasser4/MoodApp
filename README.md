Thought it would be better to start fresh with the color so here we are.

## Connect between them

I started with connect the two part of the project which each other in order to the things go smooth on the production mode.

## Styling the tracker homepage

the Important more than the tracker is the style of the tracker so started first with the style to make it stylish to my eyes, try to keep it simple the most important part hasn't come yet

## Make the Form separate

I realized I had to separate the form with its input to store its value so I could be able to send it to the server and done 

## Post the data to the api

I made a try and catch scope for the client part first havn't dug in the server yet

## Adding a loading state

Thought it would be better to add state to manage the loading to make the best user experience

## Make the server part gets the data

I've started with making a models contains the types and after that made the context part so I had to install sql from entityframwork and applied them in the program.cs

Thought it would be better to handle some error from program.cs so I do know which part causing the problem in the future and done.
